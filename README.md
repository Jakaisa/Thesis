**Deskripsi**: This research focuses on the implementation of a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) using Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in a warehouse logistics environment. The study presents a scenario where multiple AMRs transport goods from pick-up to drop-off points without collisions or deadlocks. Navigation is handled using the Dijkstra algorithm for path planning, while the Control Lyapunov Barrier Function (CLBF) is used for motion control to ensure safety and obstacle avoidance. Each AMR operates with decentralized communication, interacting only with nearby active robots, and coordination is managed through the Robot Operating System (ROS). This approach aims to enhance flexibility and efficiency in modern manufacturing systems..
